    <p>Blow on the surface of the coffee just before you sip it.  You can gauge how hot the coffee is by the heat from it, hitting your nose.  Hence you would know whether it is going to burn you or not.</p>
    <p>Stick a metal spoon in the coffee cup to dissipate the heat from the coffee to the spoon thus cooling the coffee.</p>
    <p>The final and best method for cooling a cup of coffee is to carefully pour a few swallows into the saucer, put the cup on the table, pick up the saucer. Carefully, put it up to your lips, and again exhale through your nose, and judge how hot the coffee is, then suck/slurp it into your mouth.  Thus cooling the coffee with the cold saucer, the increased surface area of the coffee in the saucer, and finally the cool air around it as you are slurping/sucking it into your mouth. </p>
    <p>One other way is to use metal coffee cups.  They dissipate the heat much quicker than ceramic or paper cups.       </p>
