       <h3>Ingrediants:  water and coffee</h3>
       <p>Water from New York tastes better than water from New Jersey.  Fresh coffee grounds taste the best.  Bottled water is better than New Jersey water, but still not as good as New York.  Coffee grounds come in many flavors, so it is also a matter of taste.  The coffee shop directly across from the St. George Library has some really good coffee.  It tastes good, wakes you up, and improves your mood, all at the same time, and I don't even know what flavor it is.  I'll have to ask.  After my first coding class I was too tired to drive home and was expecting a stale cup of coffee at four in the afternoon.  The cup I got really did the job. - </p>
           <p>Warning!  you may want to cut the coffee with some hot water or only drink half a cup, otherwise you may have trouble getting to sleep at night.</p>
