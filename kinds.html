        <p>Coffee Bags are like tea bags you dunk them up and down in the coffee cup or let them steep until your cup reaches the desired strength.  So you can vary the amount of caffeine very easily.  Even when your done dunking you can go back and dunk some more if you want it stronger, quite easily, or get a second cup later on with the same bag.  (Good if you are watching your caffeine.) </p>
        <p>Ground Coffee you put in some kind of strainer, or paper coffee filter, and percolate, or pour hot water over it.  This is probably the best coffee there is but very cumbersome and work intensive including the cleaning of the pot and strainer and percolation paraphernalia.</p>
        <p>Instant Coffee Crystals - just add hot water and the crystals let them dissolve in the water.  Virtually no clean up if you use a paper cup and drink it black, otherwise use need to stir the milk and sugar with something.  Least preferred method to make coffee in my opinion cause of the taste.</p>
